Dear Big Bird,

I'm planning for our celebration tomorrow. 
I'm really excited to party with everyone on Sesame Street. 
However, I think we did not purchase enough cookies.
I regret only buying 100 cookies instead of 1000!
Do you have any extra cookies at your house?

Mmm, cookies,
Cookie Monster

Minnie,

I am sorry about how I behaved yesterday. I was tired
and hungry and stressed out. I regret how I treated
you and I hope that you have it in your heart to forgive me.

Can I make it up to you some how? I am very sorry.

Please except my offer of an appology,
Mickey

Bob,

I've been watching your painting show that is offered on PBS.
It's great! Your trees are always so perfectly green and happy.
I must say, you hair-do is pretty sweet. 

I am your biggest fan. If I could meet you in person, it would be
like winning the lottery! What do you say?

Happy painting,
Your biggest fan.
